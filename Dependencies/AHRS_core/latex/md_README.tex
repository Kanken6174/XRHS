ARHS \mbox{[}Augmented Reality Headset System\mbox{]} is an augmented reality project aiming to use existing hardware to produce a low cost and flexible platform for on-\/the-\/go computer vision.

This repository hosts the code for ARHS-\/core, which is the code used by the headset and hence the \char`\"{}core\char`\"{} part of the system.

You\textquotesingle{}ll need opencv and hidapi if you want to test it out. A quick installation script is provided for that purpose, as {\ttfamily ./install.sh}.
